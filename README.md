# Notes on Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*

I'm using this repository to hold notes on Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* as I work through both the original book and St. Thomas Aquinas' commentary on it.

For the most part, I'm going chapter by chapter through the *Ethics* and simply trying my best to rephrase the main points. Occasionally I will pose a question or note that I don't understand some part of it.

In addition, I'm reading St. Thomas Aquinas' line-by-line commentary on the text. As I find interesting quotes I will insert them in my document. I'll preface each quote with `A[X]`, where `X` is the number of the paragraph in the commentary. (My edition has the paragraphs numbered, from 1 to 2180.) I'll also format them in blockquotes so they stand out.
