# Notes on the *Nicomachean Ethics*

This folder contains materials from a course I took on virtue and human happiness, the first half of which was dedicated to a study of Aristotle's *Ethics*.

The file `a-guide-for-reading-the-ethics.pdf` is an overall guide/commentary on the book.

Most of the other files go into detail about particular books and chapters. These are marked in the name of the file.

Finally, there are a few handouts of additional comments on themes from the book.
