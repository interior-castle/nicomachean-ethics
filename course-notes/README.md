# Notes on the *Nicomachean Ethics*

This folder contains materials from a course I took on virtue and human happiness, the first half of which was dedicated to a study of Aristotle's *Ethics*. It's all the work of my professor, Msgr. Robert Sokolowski.

The file `a-guide-for-reading-the-ethics.pdf` is an overall guide/commentary on the book that gives short summary paragraphs for each chapter in the text. Note that he works through the book out of order, beginning with book 7, reserving book 1 for the end, and with some other modifications. (The guide always makes clear which part of the book he's commenting on.) 

Most of the other files, which were individual handouts, go into detail about particular books and chapters. I organized these by indicating the books and chapters covered by the handout in the file names.

Finally, there are a few handouts of additional comments on themes from the book.
