# Book 2

## Chapter 1

Virtue is of two kinds, intellectual and moral. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains and the passions. Intellectual virtues will be discussed later. 

It is clear that moral virtue comes by training and not by nature. We often form habits opposed to virtue, which wouldn't happen if it was our nature to be virtuous. Instead, we have to train ourselves in order to act virtuously. Our nature disposes us to receive virtues, but we become temperate or just by doing temperate or just acts. (Likewise, if we perform indulgent or unjust acts, we become indulgent or unjust.)

In short, "states of character arise out of like activites." For this reason, training in virtue from youth makes a big difference, or perhaps all of the difference, in whether we end up good or bad.

## Chapter 2

Because good and right actions require the judgment of particular circumstances, there is no fixed, precise, and exact answer for which actions are virtuous. Nevertheless, in any given situation, there will be some right course of action that can go wrong either by excess or deficiency. The excesses and deficiencies have to do with our responses to pleasures and pains. Since our actions create our character, someone who consistently fails by excess will be an excessive person (e.g., self-indulgence), and someone who consistently fails by deficiency will become deficient (e.g., a coward). 

Not only do our actions create our character, but when we have the right sort of character we become more able to do virtuous things. The temperate man, who became temperate through denial of pleasure, is the one most capable of abstaining from pleasures.

## Chapter 3

Whether we feel pleasure or pain on acting tells us about our state of character. The temperate man not only abstains from pleasures but is also not pained when doing so â€” whereas an indulgent man who abstains from pleasure is pained. In fact every moral action is thus connected to pleasure and pain, which explains why training from youth in having the right appetites is so important for developing good character. It is much harder to act contrary to our passions once they are deeply ingrained. 

The inquiry of ethics, therefore, should include learning when delight and pain are felt rightly and wrongly. Politics too is, essentially, entirely concerned with pleasure and pain, particularly the pain of punishment as a deterent to bad behavior.

## Chapter 4

When we say that doing just acts makes a man just, we have to qualify what we mean, because an unjust man can on occasion perform a just action. Aristotle adds that the just man is a just man only when he does just acts in the way that just men do them. More specifically, one has to (1) have knowledge of how to act, (2) choose the act and choose it for its own sake, and (3) the act must proceed from a "firm and unchangeable character."

There is no shortcut to building virtuous character. People who "take refuge in theory" may think they have become good, but Aristotle says they are like patients who listen to doctors without ever following their orders. We have to do virtuous acts and work through mistakes and pains until we build the sort of character that allows us to successfully do virtuous things as virtuous people do them.

## Chapter 5

What are virtues? Are they passions, faculties, or states of character?

Passions are ruled out, for no one is praised or blamed for feeling, but we do praise and blame people with respect to virtue. For a similar reason, virtue cannot be a faculty, because people are not praised or blamed merely for having certain capacities but for exercising them. "We have the faculties by nature, but we are not made good or bad by nature." All that remains, therefore, is that virtue is a state of character.

## Chapter 6

What sort of state of character is virtue? It's what brings a man into a good condition and causes his work to be done well. As we saw before, what counts as right action exists on a continuum between extremes of excess and deficiency: of feeling or acting too much or too little. It follows that wherever on that continuum right action happens to be, that place will be an intermediate or mean, a balanced point that avoids the many possible failures of excess or deficiency. With respect to passions, the intermediate is when we feel them "at the right times, in reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way." And similarly with respect to actions. 

It's easy to miss the mark and hard to hit it, because there are many more ways to miss than to hit. "Men are good in but one way, but bad in many."

A nice analogy: "We often say of good works of art that it is not possible either to take away or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the goodness of the works of art, while the mean preserves it; and good artists, as we say, look to this in their work." So it is with right action in a given set of circumstances.

Not every action and passion have a mean, because some are named on account of their badness. There is no right amount of adultery or theft. Likewise, there is no such thing as an extreme of temperance, because the term itself denotes an intermediate.

## Chapter 7

Aristotle sketches an outline of the moral virtues and vices:

| Object | Mean | Excess | Deficiency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fear and confidence | Courage | No name (foolhardy, indulgent in fearful activity) and Rash (overconfidence) | Coward |
| Pleasures | Temperate | Indulgent | No name (insensible) |
| Giving or taking money | Generosity | Prodigality | Stinginess |
| Money on a large scale | Magnificence | Tastlessness or vulgarity | Miserliness |
| Honor and dishonor | Magnanimity | Empty vanity | Undue humility |
| Smaller honors | No name | Ambition | Unambition |
| Anger | Good tempered | Irascible | Inirascible |
| Truth | Truthfulness | Boastful | Mock modesty |
| Social pleasantness | Ready wit, charming | Buffoonery | Boorishness |
| General pleasantness | Friendliness | Obsequious (no purpose) or flatterer (with purpose) | Quarrelsome or surly |
| Shame | Modest | Bashfulness | Shamelessness |
| Fortunes of neighbors | Righteous indignation (pained at unjust fortune) | Envy (pain at good fortune) | Spitefulness (joy at misfortune) |

Notes:
* Justice will be treated separately in its own book, as will intellectual virtues.
* Some vices are not often found and thus have no names (e.g., insensible).
* The mean for smaller honors has no stable name, but we tend to call the person with the virtue by either "ambition" or "unambition" in contrast to the extreme his mean is opposing in a particular case.
* Aristotle connects the virtues of truthfulness, ready wit, and friendliness together as all pertaining to intercourse in words and actions, with the latter two both being concerned with giving pleasure in that sphere.
* Feeling shame is a passion, but Aristotle notes we nevertheless praise and blame how much people allow themselves to feel it. This shows there are "means in the passions and concerned with the passions."
