# Book 2

## Chapter 1

Virtue is of two kinds, intellectual and moral. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains and the passions. Intellectual virtues will be discussed later. 

It is clear that moral virtue comes by training and not by nature. We often form habits opposed to virtue, which wouldn't happen if it was our nature to be virtuous. Instead, we have to train ourselves in order to act virtuously. Our nature disposes us to receive virtues, but we become temperate or just by doing temperate or just acts. (Likewise, if we perform indulgent or unjust acts, we become indulgent or unjust.)

There's a nice contrast here: With things that are given by nature, the capacity comes first, and the activity comes from it. But in moral matters, you acquire the capacity by first exercising the act. The capacity of the senses is had by nature; whereas virtues and arts you exercise before you even get the capacity.

In short, "states of character arise out of like activities." For this reason, training in virtue from youth makes a big difference, or perhaps all of the difference, in whether we end up good or bad.

> A[247]: "Moral virtue is derived from customary activity. Now moral virtue, found in the appetitive part, implies a certain inclination to something desirable. This inclination is either from nature, which tends to what is agreeable to itself, or from custom, which is transformed into nature."
> 
> A[248]: "We are perfected in [virtue] by use, for when we act repeatedly according to reason, a modification is impressed in the appetite by the power of reason. This impression is nothing else but moral virtue."

## Chapter 2

Because good and right actions require the judgment of particular circumstances, there is no fixed, precise, and exact answer for which actions are virtuous. Nevertheless, in any given situation, there will be — *for us*, not objectively — some right course of action that can go wrong either by excess or deficiency. The excesses and deficiencies have to do with our actions and response to pleasures and pains. Since our actions create our character, someone who consistently fails by excess will be an excessive person (e.g., self-indulgence), and someone who consistently fails by deficiency will become deficient (e.g., a coward). 

Not only do our actions create our character, but when we have the right sort of character we become more able to do virtuous things. The temperate man, who became temperate through denial of pleasure, is the one most capable of abstaining from pleasures.

## Chapter 3

Whether we feel pleasure or pain on acting tells us about our state of character. The temperate man not only abstains from pleasures but is also not pained when doing so — whereas an indulgent man who abstains from pleasure is pained. In fact every moral action is thus connected to pleasure and pain, which explains why training from youth in having the right appetites is so important for developing good character. It is much harder to act contrary to our passions once they are deeply ingrained. 

The inquiry of ethics, therefore, should include learning when delight and pain are felt rightly and wrongly. Politics too is, essentially, entirely concerned with pleasure and pain, particularly the pain of punishment as a deterrent to bad behavior.

## Chapter 4

When we say that doing just acts makes a man just, we have to qualify what we mean, because an unjust man can on occasion perform a just action. Aristotle adds that the just man is a just man only when he does just acts in the way that just men do them. More specifically, one has to (1) have knowledge of how to act, (2) choose the act and choose it for its own sake, and (3) the act must proceed from a "firm and unchangeable character."

> A[283]: "We must pay attention to three things: (1) **The first, pertaining to the intellect or reason**, is that one who performs a virtuous action should not act in ignorance or by chance and should know what he is doing. (2) **The second is taken on the part of the appetitive power**. Here two things are noted. One is that the action be not done out of passion, as happens when a person performs a virtuous deed because of fear. But the action should be done by a choice that is not made for the sake of something else, as happens when a person performs a good action for money or vainglory. The actions should be done for the sake of the virtuous work itself which, as something agreeable, is inherently pleasing to him who has the habit of virtue. (3) **The third, taken from the nature of a habit,** is that a person should possess a virtuous choice and operate according to it resolutely — that is, consistently on his part — and with stability so as not to be moved by any external thing."
> 
> A[284]: "Only the first of these, knowledge, is required in the arts. A man can be a good artist even if he never chooses to work according to art and does not persevere in his work. But knowledge has little or no importance in a person being virtuous, but his goodness consists entirely in other things that take place within him by frequent actions, and thus he becomes stable."

There is no shortcut to building virtuous character, no overnight conversion. People who "take refuge in theory" may think they have become good, but Aristotle says they are like patients who listen to doctors without ever following their orders. We have to do virtuous acts and work through mistakes and pains until we build the sort of character that allows us to successfully do virtuous things as virtuous people do them.

> A[288]: "Philosophy is to the cure of the soul what medicine is to the cure of the body. Hence, as those who listen to the advice of doctors and disregard it will never have a well regulated body, so those who listen to the warnings of moral philosophers and do not heed them will never have a well regulated soul."

## Chapter 5

What are virtues? Are they passions, faculties, or states of character? Aristotle is asking what genus virtue belongs to.

Passions are ruled out, for no one is praised or blamed for feeling, but we do praise and blame people with respect to virtue. For a similar reason, virtue cannot be a faculty, because people are not praised or blamed merely for having certain capacities but for exercising them. "We have the faculties by nature, but we are not made good or bad by nature." All that remains, therefore, is that virtue is a state of character.

## Chapter 6

With the genus (state of character) determined, now we need to know what the difference (species) is. What sort of state of character is virtue? It's what brings a man into a good condition and causes his work to be done well. As we saw before, what counts as right action exists on a continuum between extremes of excess and deficiency: of feeling or acting too much or too little. It follows that wherever on that continuum right action happens to be, that place will be an intermediate or mean, a balanced point that avoids the many possible failures of excess or deficiency. With respect to passions, the intermediate is when we feel them "at the right times, in reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way." And similarly with respect to actions. 

It's easy to miss the mark and hard to hit it, because there are many more ways to miss than to hit. "Men are good in but one way, but bad in many."

A nice analogy: "We often say of good works of art that it is not possible either to take away or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the goodness of the works of art, while the mean preserves it; and good artists, as we say, look to this in their work." So it is with right action in a given set of circumstances.

Not every action and passion have a mean, because some are named on account of their badness or goodness. There is no right amount of adultery or theft, no right way or place or time to do them. Likewise, there is no such thing as an extreme of temperance, because the term itself denotes an intermediate.

**Bottom line**: the definition of virtue given in this chapter is that virtue is a *disposition* dealing with *choice* (genus), regarding the *middle* for us (difference) — namely the middle as determined by *reason*, namely as the *virtuous agent* would determine it.

## Chapter 7

Aristotle sketches an outline of the moral virtues and vices:

| Object | Mean | Excess | Deficiency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fear and confidence | Courage | No name (foolhardy, indulgent in fearful activity) and Rash (overconfidence) | Coward |
| Pleasures | Temperate | Indulgent | No name (insensible) |
| Giving or taking money | Generosity | Prodigality | Stinginess |
| Money on a large scale | Magnificence | Tastelessness or vulgarity | Miserliness |
| Honor and dishonor | Magnanimity | Empty vanity | Undue humility |
| Smaller honors | No name | Ambition | Unambition |
| Anger | Good tempered | Irascible | Inirascible |
| Truth | Truthfulness | Boastful | Mock modesty |
| Social pleasantness | Ready wit, charming | Buffoonery | Boorishness |
| General pleasantness | Friendliness | Obsequious (no purpose) or flatterer (with purpose) | Quarrelsome or surly |
| Shame | Modest | Bashfulness | Shamelessness |
| Fortunes of neighbors | Righteous indignation (pained at unjust fortune) | Envy (pain at good fortune) | Spitefulness (joy at misfortune) |

Notes:
* Justice will be treated separately in its own book, as will intellectual virtues.
* Some vices are not often found and thus have no names (e.g., insensible).
* The mean for smaller honors has no stable name, but we tend to call the person with the virtue by either "ambition" or "unambition" in contrast to the extreme his mean is opposing in a particular case.
* Aristotle connects the virtues of truthfulness, ready wit, and friendliness together as all pertaining to intercourse in words and actions, with the latter two both being concerned with giving pleasure in that sphere.
* Feeling shame is a passion, but Aristotle notes we nevertheless praise and blame how much people allow themselves to feel it. This shows there are "means in the passions and concerned with the passions."

## Chapter 8

The three possible states — mean, excess, and defect — exist relative to one another and are in a sense opposed to each other. For example, the temperate man seems deficient from the point of view of the indulgent man. Some extremes in excess or deficiency are more like the intermediate than their opposites: the rash man is closer to courage than the coward, and the insensible man more like the temperate than the self-indulgent. In general, the excesses or defects we more naturally tend toward (like indulgence) seem like they are more opposed to the mean than their opposite extreme.

## Chapter 9

We have now sketched out the landscape of the moral virtues. This has revealed that being good is no easy task, since it is not easy to find the mean of action or feeling passion with respect to so many objects in so many circumstances. Anyone can get angry, but getting angry in the right way, at the right time, at the right things, to the right extent, and with the right motive is difficult. "Therefore goodness is both rare and laudable and noble."

Most people, then, should take the tactic of aiming not exactly at the mean but moreso in the direction of the extreme they are less inclined to. For instance, they should aim at abstaining from pleasure more than they might think is precisely the mean, since it is hard to judge and we are prone to indulgence. "Hold the ship out beyond the surf and spray" — so that we hit our target after our course is altered by failures.
