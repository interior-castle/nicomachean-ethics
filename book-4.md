## Chapter 1
### *Liberality*

Virtue with respect to wealth consists in taking and giving properly. The more difficult, uncommon, socially useful, and praised thing is to *give* wealth well, and hence this virtue is more associated with giving and called liberality. 

The liberal man gives for the sake of doing what's noble, and he does so with pleasure, or at least without pain. He is a shrewd manager of his own resources so that he will have wealth to give â€” this is in contrast to the prodigal man who runs through his own substance. Likewise, the liberal man is selective in his giving and skilled at picking the right people at the right time, giving the right amounts, for noble causes, etc.

Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the liberal man to give almost excessively, such that he ends with less wealth than he starts with. This is because he values doing noble things more than possessing wealth, and he sees wealth as a means to the end of noble giving. (Misers, by contrast, see their wealth as a representation of their own achievement and part with it only grudgingly.)

Aristotle: "Hence comes the charge that is brought against fortune, that those who deserve riches most get it least. But it is not unreasonable that it should turn out so; for he cannot have wealth, any more than anything else, if he does not take pains to have it."

Of the vices opposed to liberality, meanness is worse than prodigality. This is because it's more commonly found in men, who are more apt to receive than give, and their condition is and becomes more incurable, especially as they age. Prodigals at least have the impulse to give, which is closer to being correct; they just need to be taught to do so moderately. And this is something teachable, either through wiser men instructing them, or sometimes it is learned through the poverty caused by prodigality early in life.
