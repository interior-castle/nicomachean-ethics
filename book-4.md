## Chapter 1
### *Liberality*

Virtue with respect to wealth consists in taking and giving properly. The more difficult, uncommon, socially useful, and praised thing is to *give* wealth well, and hence this virtue is more associated with giving and called liberality. 

The liberal man gives for the sake of doing what's noble, and he does so with pleasure, or at least without pain. He is a competent manager of his own resources so that he will have wealth to give — this is in contrast to the prodigal man who runs through his own substance. Likewise, the liberal man is selective in his giving and skilled at picking the right people to give to, at the right time, in the right amounts, for noble causes, etc.

Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the liberal man to give almost excessively, such that he ends with less wealth than he starts with. This is because he values doing noble things more than possessing wealth, and he sees wealth as a means to the end of noble giving. (Misers, by contrast, see their wealth as a representation of their own achievement and part with it only grudgingly.)

Aristotle: "Hence comes the charge that is brought against fortune, that those who deserve riches most get it least. But it is not unreasonable that it should turn out so; for he cannot have wealth, any more than anything else, if he does not take pains to have it."

Of the vices opposed to liberality, meanness is worse than prodigality. This is because it's more commonly found in men, who are innately more apt to receive than give and who tend to become incurable in their vice as life's challenges and old age make him think he is in need. Prodigals at least have the impulse to give, which is closer to being correct; they just need to be taught to do so moderately. And this is something teachable, either through wiser men instructing them, or sometimes it is learned the hard way, through the poverty caused by prodigality early in life.

## Chapter 2
### *Magnificence*

The next virtue to consider is an extension of liberality and connected with wealth, but concerns only giving on a large scale. Magnificence is a virtue of men who have the means to spend money on a public good, at a large scale, and do so excellently. The money is spent fittingly on the right sorts of events and projects, with good taste and an eye for what will stand the test of time. The event or work serves as a monument that brings honor to the man who gives it, and he supplies it lavishly, gladly, and without "nice calculation" — that is, small-minded concerns that are out of place in a large-scale project. (Aquinas in p. 715: "Great caution in accounting or computing expenses pertains to illiberality.")

A poor man cannot be magnificent, by definition: if he were to attempt to spend lavishly, it could not be proportionate to his means and therefore could not be virtuous. One who attempts this is a fool. 

Excess in large-scale spending is vulgar and tasteless. A vulgar man will spend too much for things of lesser importance (e.g., running an ordinary dinner party like a wedding banquet), and he will spend too little when it counts (e.g., using showy but shoddy materials for a public building). He uses extravagance to vainly chase admiration, as opposed to honorable and good ends.

Those who fall short are niggardly or miserly. They are hesitant to spend great sums and generally spend too little, and to the extent they do spend they lament that they are giving too much. They are also liable to ruin the beauty of a public gift or work by quibbling over trifles in a small-minded way.

> A[708]: "Although magnitude indicates a kind of excess, we are not to understand that the munificent person spends on such a grand scale that he exceeds the bounds of reason, but his expenditures are made in amounts that are also in keeping with what is becoming."

> A[711]: "... the vice by excess, *banausia* (ostentation) from *baunos* meaning furnace, because such as have the vice consume all their goods as in a furnace. If other terms of this kind exist, they come under the name *apirocalia* (lack of taste): offenders being, as it were, without experience of what is suitable because they do not know how to do the proper thing. Such names signify excess not because they surpass the munificent person in the amount of disbursements on the right projects, but they are excessive in going beyond right reason, spending, with a certain display, great sums on the wrong things."

> A[712]: "[The magnificent person] is like a wise man. The reason is that, as it belongs to a wise craftsman to know the proportion of one thing to another, so also it belongs to the munificent man to know the proportion between expenditures and that for which the expenditures are made. In virtue of this habit the munificent man is able to judge what may be proper to spend. Thus he will make grand disbursements in a prudent way, because prudent operation is required for every moral virtue."

> A[713]: "So then the project on which the money is spent must be such that it is worthy of the cost or expense, and this ought to be worthy of the work, or in excess of it. It is very difficult to attain the mean; hence if a departure from the mean should occur, virtue always inclines to what has less evil, as the brave man to less fear, the liberal man to giving, and so the munificent man to more spending."

> A[719]: "The gentiles, however, worshiped not only gods, i.e., certain separated substances, but also demons whom they held to be intermediaries between gods and men. Therefore, he adds that everything expended on the worship of any demon whatsoever belongs to [magnificence]. The Philosopher speaks here of a heathen custom that has been abrogated by the plain truth. Hence if someone now spent any money on the worship of a demon, he would not be munificent but sacrilegious."

> A[727]: "The splendid gifts bestowed on some resemble those given to God. The reason is that, as offerings are consecrated to God not because he needs them but out of reverence and honor, so also presents are made to distinguished men more on account of honor than any need."

## Chapter 3
### *Magnanimity*

"The man is thought to be proud who thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy of them. ... The proud man, then, is an extreme in respect of the greatness of his claims, but a mean in respect of the rightness of them." (In the Latin translation: "The magnanimous man holds an extreme in extension but a mean in appropriateness, for his thinks himself deserving in accord with his worth.")

There is a virtue, for great men, in knowing that they are great and worthy of great things and in claiming them. Internally, their greatness and just reward is the virtue and happiness they possess, which is self-sufficient. Externally, the only fitting thing that can be given to them by others is honor. While honor doesn't match the value of the proud man's virtue, nevertheless it's the highest thing human beings can give — for similar reasons are the gods also honored.

A proud man must be worthy of the honor he claims, so he must be good in the highest degree, great in every other virtue. The vain exceed the mean by claiming honor beyond their deserts, and those who deserve great honors but do not claim them (or reject them) are unduly humble and deficient with respect to the mean. The honors in question should also be those given by good men; a proud man doesn't care what lesser people think of him, whether it's good or bad. Because he despises the judgments of lesser men, people believe proud men to be disdainful. But his judgment is just and correct.

Because honors are granted both for virtue and for certain goods of fortune, like being well-born or in holding a position of power, sometimes it happens that bad men receive honor on account of their external goods. In that case, they try to act with pride but fail to act well, and end up doing whatever they please at random while despising other people.

Aristotle: "What is great in every virtue pertains to magnanimity."

> Sokolowski: "Note that ... the proud man is really beyond honor, because although he will accept it, he does not need it to confirm his awareness of his own nobility. The nobility expresses itself even in his bodily form, in his voice and movement."

> A[740]: "The small-souled person is one who refuses to strive after great accomplishments and aims at certain petty undertakings when he is truly capable of what is great. He would bring himself down to affairs more trifling still, except for the fact that he is capable of great things."

> A[ST II-II, Q. 129, a1]: "Since a virtuous habit is denominated chiefly from its act, a man is said to be magnanimous chiefly because he is minded to do some great act. ... If ... one were to despise honors so as not to care to do what is worthy of honor, this would be deserving of blame. Accordingly magnanimity is about honors in the sense that a man strives to do what is deserving of honor, yet not so as to think much of the honor accorded by man."

> A[ST II-II Q. 129, a2]: "He that makes good use of great things is much more able to make good use of little things. Accordingly the magnanimous man looks upon great honors as a thing of which he is worthy, or even little honors as something he deserves. ... Hence he is not uplifted by great honors, because he does not deem them above him; rather does he despise them, and much more such as are ordinary or little. In like manner he is not cast down by dishonor, but despises it, since he recognizes that he does not deserve it."

> A[746]: "He shows how magnanimity is a special virtue when it accompanies other virtues. He says that what is great it any virtue seems to pertain to magnanimity because one who does not perform a great act of virtue is not worthy of great honor. ... Fortitude [for example] intends a courageous action, magnanimity strives for a great deed in the courageous action. Since moral acts take their species from the end to which they tend, it is clear that magnanimity and fortitude differ in species, although they operate in the same matter, because neither virtue follows the same motive."

> Alexandre Havard: "Aquinas takes up the formulae of Aristotle, but gives them a different meaning. Whereas Aristotle says that the magnanimous man considers himself worthy of great things (great honors), Aquinas says he considers himself worthy of *doing* great things, which he aims to accomplish for themselves and their inherent grandeur. At the same time, he finds that, without wanting to, he has merited honor, and now must make good use of it."

> Alexandre Havard: "What the magnanimous person seeks in each virtue is not only the good specific to it, but also the greatness contained within it, the flourishing of his personality and the perfection he achieves through it. By the same token, what the magnanimous person flees in fleeing vice is not the evil specific to it, but rather the smallness, the diminution in stature, the decline implicit in it."

> A[ST II-II Q. 129, a3]: *Objection*: No virtue is opposed to another, but magnanimity is opposed to humility, since "the magnanimous deems himself worthy of great things and despises others." *Reply*: There is in man something great which he possesses through the gift of God; and something defective which accrues to him through the weakness of nature. Accordingly magnanimity makes a man deem himself worthy of great things in consideration of the gifts he holds from God: thus if his soul is endowed with great virtue, magnanimity makes him tend to perfect works of virtue; and the same is to be said of the use of any other good, such as science or external fortune. On the other hand, humility makes a man think little of himself in consideration of his own deficiency, and magnanimity makes him despise others in so far as they fall away from God's gifts: since he does not think so much of others as to do anything wrong for their sake. Yet humility makes us honor others and esteem them better than ourselves, in so far as we see some of God's gifts in them. Hence it is written of the just man (Ps. 14:4): "In his sight a vile person is contemned," which indicates the contempt of magnanimity, "but he honoreth them that fear the Lord," which points to the reverential bearing of humility. It is therefore evident that magnanimity and humility are not contrary to one another, although they seem to tend in contrary directions, because they proceed according to different considerations.

## Chapter 4
### *Smaller honors*

Just as giving money has two virtues that correspond to small amounts (liberality) and large amounts (magnificence), so also are there two virtues for great honors (magnanimity) and small honors. 

The virtue for desiring small honors moderately has no name. Interestingly, we tend to refer to the mean by the same name as the extremes, depending on the situation. Specifically, we sometimes praise people for ambition when it's reasonable, thinking them manly and a lover of what's noble. And other times we praise people for refraining from ambition, thinking that more reasonable and moderate in those circumstances. The virtuous man will seem extreme in the direction opposite to whichever vice is being considered. (We do this also for other virtues: for example, the brave man seems reckless compared to the coward.)

Aristotle: "The mean being with a name, the extremes seem to dispute for its place as though that were vacant by default."

> A[795]: "The mean in this matter is praiseworthy according as honor and desire for honor are valued at their true worth."

## Chapter 5
### *Meekness*

The mean with respect to anger is yet another virtue without a name, and interestingly neither do its extremes have names. We can call the mean "good tempered" and the extremes irascibility and inirascibility.

There are several kinds of excess in anger: we can distinguish according to how quickly a person gets angry, what things or people they get angry with, and how long the anger persists. The hot-tempered man gets angry quickly at too many things, but his anger subsides quickly as well. The sullen "digest" their anger, which can take a long time, and tend to be burdensome on friends. Some people are "ill-tempered," being angry at the wrong things, for too long, and only appeased by vengeance. These excesses are a more common vice than the deficiency.

It's hard to say exactly how much is the right amount of anger, at what things, held for how long, etc. The difficulty of judgment in this area means that we are more lenient in how we assess people, often praising anger (or its lack) in deviations from the mean — as long as such deviations are minor.

> A[804]: "Since the Stoics were of the opinion that all anger is censurable, he consequently shows that the defect of anger sometimes is censurable. ... It is evident that anger is caused by sadness. But sadness is a feeling of injury. If then someone fails to be angry at the things he should, he does not grieve for them and so does not feel they are evil. This pertains to a lack of wisdom."


## Chapter 6
### Amiability

There is a virtue in giving pleasure to others through general social interaction. This virtue, amiability or friendliness, can feel like friendship, but it differs from friendship in that the amiable man is pleasant to all alike, rather than to certain people on account of his affection for them. There is a fitting objectivity to his social grace, a rational detachment that allows him to say what will be friendly to any given person according to their standing, station in life, and circumstances.

Those who strive to give pleasure always in every situation do so excessively. When they do so merely by disposition, they are obsequious. Flatterers do the same thing but with an eye toward some gain. On the other extreme are the churlish or boorish, who lack social grace and tend to quarrel.

As a general rule the amiable man strives to give pleasure to others, but this is moderated by a commitment to truth, justice, honor, and the like. Sometimes a situation requires causing others pain by your speech, for example to avoid disgrace, dishonor, or harm. Nevertheless, amiability is characterized most by its pleasantness.

## Chapter 7
### Truthfulness

Aristotle: "The man who observes the mean is one who calls a thing by its own name, being truthful both in life and in word, owning to what he has, and neither more nor less."

The virtues and vices associated with truthfulness concern how we speak about and portray ourselves to others. The truthful person "calls a thing by its own name" and avoids either exagerating what he has or belittling it. He is tastefully modest and inclines toward understatement, which is attractive in its restraint. Those who boast force others to notice them, which is wearisome.

Mock-modest people are better liked than the boastful, because they self-deprecate in order to avoid accolades. Still, they achieve this by embracing falsehoods, which is something that ought to be avoided for its own sake.

The extreme deficiency of truthfulness, when one disclaims even trifling and obvious things, is not mock modesty but instead comes back around to a kind of boastfulness. Such people discard ordinary and conventional things in a showy way, implying that they are far superior to what they discard — and perhaps far superior to the people who make use of those things. There is an arrogance to these extreme displays even though they are superficially deprivations.
