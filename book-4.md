## Chapter 1
### *Liberality*

Virtue with respect to wealth consists in taking and giving properly. The more difficult, uncommon, socially useful, and praised thing is to *give* wealth well, and hence this virtue is more associated with giving and called liberality. 

The liberal man gives for the sake of doing what's noble, and he does so with pleasure, or at least without pain. He is a competent manager of his own resources so that he will have wealth to give — this is in contrast to the prodigal man who runs through his own substance. Likewise, the liberal man is selective in his giving and skilled at picking the right people at the right time, giving the right amounts, for noble causes, etc.

Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the liberal man to give almost excessively, such that he ends with less wealth than he starts with. This is because he values doing noble things more than possessing wealth, and he sees wealth as a means to the end of noble giving. (Misers, by contrast, see their wealth as a representation of their own achievement and part with it only grudgingly.)

Aristotle: "Hence comes the charge that is brought against fortune, that those who deserve riches most get it least. But it is not unreasonable that it should turn out so; for he cannot have wealth, any more than anything else, if he does not take pains to have it."

Of the vices opposed to liberality, meanness is worse than prodigality. This is because it's more commonly found in men, who are innately more apt to receive than give and who tend to become incurable in their vice as life's challenges and old age make him think he is in need. Prodigals at least have the impulse to give, which is closer to being correct; they just need to be taught to do so moderately. And this is something teachable, either through wiser men instructing them, or sometimes it is learned through the poverty caused by prodigality early in life.

## Chapter 2
### *Magnificence*

The next virtue to consider is an extension of liberality and connected with wealth, but concerns only giving on a large scale. Magnificence is a virtue of men who have the means to spend money on a public good, at a large scale, and do so excellently. The money is spent fittingly on the right sorts of events and projects, with good taste and an eye for what will stand the test of time. The event or work serves as a monument that brings honor to the man who gives it, and he supplies it lavishly, gladly, and without "nice calculation" — that is, small-minded concerns that are out of place in a large-scale project. (Aquinas in p. 715: "Great caution in accounting or computing expenses pertains to illiberality.")

A poor man cannot be magnificent, by definition: if he were to attempt to spend lavishly, it could not be proportionate to his means and therefore could not be virtuous. One who attempts this is a fool. 

Excess in large-scale spending is vulgar and tasteless. A vulgar man will spend too much for things of lesser importance (e.g., running an ordinary dinner party like a wedding banquet), and he will spend too little when it counts (e.g., using showy but shoddy materials for a public building). He uses extravagance to vainly chase admiration, as opposed to honorable and good ends.

Those who fall short are niggardly or miserly. They are hesitant to spend great sums and generally spend too little, and to the extent they do spend they lament that they are giving too much. They are also liable to ruin the beauty of a public gift or work by quibbling over trifles in a small-minded way.

> A[708]: "Although magnitude indicates a kind of excess, we are not to understand that the munificent person spends on such a grand scale that he exceeds the bounds of reason, but his expenditures are made in amounts that are also in keeping with what is becoming."

> A[711]: "... the vice by excess, *banausia* (ostentation) from *baunos* meaning furnace, because such as have the vice consume all their goods as in a furnace. If other terms of this kind exist, they come under the name *apirocalia* (lack of taste): offenders being, as it were, without experience of what is suitable because they do not know how to do the proper thing. Such names signify excess not because they surpass the munificent person in the amount of disbursements on the right projects, but they are excessive in going beyond right reason, spending, with a certain display, great sums on the wrong things."

> A[712]: "[The magnificent person] is like a wise man. The reason is that, as it belongs to a wise craftsman to know the proportion of one thing to another, so also it belongs to the munificent man to know the proportion between expenditures and that for which the expenditures are made. In virtue of this habit the munificent man is able to judge what may be proper to spend. Thus he will make grand disbursements in a prudent way, because prudent operation is required for every moral virtue."

> A[713]: "So then the project on which the money is spent must be such that it is worthy of the cost or expense, and this ought to be worthy of the work, or in excess of it. It is very difficult to attain the mean; hence if a departure from the mean should occur, virtue always inclines to what has less evil, as the brave man to less fear, the liberal man to giving, and so the munificent man to more spending."

> A[719]: "The gentiles, however, worshiped not only gods, i.e., certain separated substances, but also demons whom they held to be intermediaries between gods and men. Therefore, he adds that everything expended on the worship of any demon whatsoever belongs to [magnificence]. The Philosopher speaks here of a heathen custom that has been abrogated by the plain truth. Hence if someone now spent any money on the worship of a demon, he would not be munificent but sacrilegious."

> A[727]: "The splendid gifts bestowed on some resemble those given to God. The reason is that, as offerings are consecrated to God not because he needs them but out of reverence and honor, so also presents are made to distinguished men more on account of honor than any need."

## Chapter 3
### *Magnanimity*

"The man is thought to be proud who thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy of them. ... The proud man, then, is an extreme in respect of the greatness of his claims, but a mean in respect of the rightness of them."

There is a virtue, for great men, in knowing that they are great and worthy of great things and in claiming them. Internally, their greatness and just reward is the virtue and happiness they possess, which is self-sufficient. Externally, the only fitting thing that can be given to them by others is honor. While honor doesn't match the value of the proud man's virtue, nevertheless it's the highest thing human beings can give — for similar reasons are the gods also honored.

A proud man must be worthy of the honor he claims, so he must be good in the highest degree, great in every other virtue. The vain exceed the mean by claiming honor beyond their deserts, and those who deserve great honors but do not claim them (or reject them) are unduly humble and deficient with respect to the mean. The honors in question should also be those given by good men; a proud man doesn't care what lesser people think of him, whether it's good or bad. Because he despises the judgments of lesser men, people believe proud men to be disdainful. But his judgment is just and correct.

Because honors are granted both for virtue and for certain goods of fortune, like being well-born or in holding a position of power, sometimes it happens that bad men receive honor on account of their external goods. In that case, they try to act with pride but fail to act well, and end up doing whatever they please at random while despising other people.

> Sokolowski: "Note that ... the proud man is really beyond honor, because although he will accept it, he does not need it to confirm his awareness of his own nobility. The nobility expresses itself even in his bodily form, in his voice and movement."
