# Book 3

## Chapter 1

Opening of the discussion of voluntariness and choice. 

Coercion and ignorance can make an action involuntary, or at least affect the extent to which we see it as being voluntary. 

Regarding coercion, only in cases where an external agent is the sole cause does the coercion render the action involuntary. Otherwise, it is mixed, and mixed actions are more like the voluntary, because while the person acting is doing something they normally would not do, still they make the choice. The main question is whether fear renders actions involuntary — it does not.

Regarding ignorance, he makes a number of distinctions. Aristotle is most interested in a certain ignorance of particulars that results in actions we regret and are pained by. This kind of ignorance makes our actions involuntary. But there are several other kinds of ignorance that, for various reasons, do not make our actions involuntary. 

An action is voluntary when the moving principle is in the agent himself and when he is aware of the circumstances of his action.

> A[407]: "A thing is sorrowful because it is opposed to the will."

## Chapter 2

Choice is a subset of voluntary actions. It is not appetite, wish, or opinion.

Interesting observation where Aristotle rejects the idea that choice is an appetite: "Choice is not common to irrational creatures as well, but appetite and anger are. Again, the incontinent man acts with appetite, but not with choice; while the continent man on the contrary acts with choice, but not appetite."

Choices can be distinguished from wishes in multiple ways:

| Wishes (may) concern | Choices concern |
| --- | --- |
| Impossibles | Possibles |
| Chosen by others | Chosen by me |
| Things at a distance | Here and now |
| Ends | Means |

Neither is choice an opinion, since mere opinion lacks the moral dimension we see in choices — how they form our character and how praise/blame are (not) assigned to them.

Aristotle ends inconclusively. What is choice? It's something involving the rational principle and thought. It's voluntary — but not all things voluntary are choices. He's defined it mostly by negation.
