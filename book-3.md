# Book 3

## Chapter 1
### *Voluntariness*

Opening of the discussion of voluntariness and choice. 

Coercion and ignorance can make an action involuntary, or at least affect the extent to which we see it as being voluntary. 

Regarding coercion, only in cases where an external agent is the sole cause does the coercion render the action involuntary. Otherwise, it is mixed, and mixed actions are more like the voluntary, because while the person acting is doing something they normally would not do, still they make the choice. The main question is whether fear renders actions involuntary — it does not.

Regarding ignorance, he makes a number of distinctions. Aristotle is most interested in a certain ignorance of particulars that results in actions we regret and are pained by. This kind of ignorance makes our actions involuntary. But there are several other kinds of ignorance that, for various reasons, do not make our actions involuntary. 

An action is voluntary when the moving principle is in the agent himself and when he is aware of the circumstances of his action.

> A[407]: "A thing is sorrowful because it is opposed to the will."

## Chapter 2 
### *Choice and wish*

Choice is a subset of voluntary actions. It is not appetite, wish, or opinion.

Interesting observation where Aristotle rejects the idea that choice is an appetite: "Choice is not common to irrational creatures as well, but appetite and anger are. Again, the incontinent man acts with appetite, but not with choice; while the continent man on the contrary acts with choice, but not appetite."

Choices can be distinguished from wishes in multiple ways:

| Wishes (may) concern | Choices concern |
| --- | --- |
| Impossibles | Possibles |
| Chosen by others | Chosen by me |
| Things at a distance | Here and now |
| Ends | Means |

Neither is choice an opinion, since mere opinion lacks the moral dimension we see in choices — how they form our character and how praise/blame are (not) assigned to them.

Aristotle ends inconclusively. What is choice? It's something involving the rational principle and thought. It's voluntary — but not all things voluntary are choices. He's defined it mostly by negation.

## Chapter 3 
### *Deliberation*

Deliberation is the activity of a rational agent who is deciding between means to an end. Thus it falls under what is in our power and can be done. Not everything we can think about is an object of deliberation, only things we make choices about, things that might be brought about by our own efforts. Our deliberation assumes an end (and we don't deliberate about ends); what we have to decide on is the best means to attain the end we have in view.

> Sokolowski: "Deliberation sorts out how the agent can bring the wishable from a distance to something 'near' that he can achieve here and now; it is practical thinking."

> A[470]: "If a man should wish to deliberate about things that rarely happen, for instance, about the possible collapse of a stone bridge over which he must pass, he will never get anything done."

## Chapter 4 
### *The apparent good*

When we wish for something, we wish for what is — to us — the apparent good. This does not imply (contra modern thinking) that there is no objective good or that all wishes express mere personal preference. Rather, it highlights the importance of having good character. There is an objective good out there, and it's the good man who is most capable of perceiving it as such and wishing for it. Whereas evil men might wish for any chance thing. 

Our perception of pleasure especially tends to mislead people, making things appear to be good when they are, in fact, not. This is especially the case for vicious people, who follow their senses more than their reason.

## Chapter 5 
### *Choice and moral character*

We can now put together concepts from the start of book 3 to say: Our actions are choices, voluntary, and follow a deliberation that determines the best means to achieve the ends we wish for. Therefore, virtuous and vicious actions, and the states of character they create, are within our power. Happiness and wickedness are ultimately voluntary.

Over time, the character we develop by our actions is stable and fixed. While we establish it by free choice, once it is established, it cannot be changed without great difficulty, if at all. Hence, our moral character is voluntary but in a different sense than are our actions. 

"When you have let a stone go, it is too late to recover it; but yet it was in your power to throw it, since the moving principle was in you."

> A[512]: "If a man wills some cause from which he knows a particular effect results, it follows that he wills that effect. Although perhaps he does not intend that effect in itself, nevertheless he rather wishes that the effect exist than that the cause not exist. Thus if someone wishes to walk when it is hot, knowing beforehand he will work up a sweat, it follows that he wishes to perspire. ... It is unreasonable for a man to will to do unjust actions and nevertheless not intend to be unjust or to will to perpetrate seductions and not will to be incontinent."

This ends the discussion of the will. Now Aristotle turns to the virtues and vices he sketched in outline in book 2.

## Chapter 6 
### *Definition of courage*

Courage is a mean dealing with fear and rashness. Not the fear of every evil thing, but most properly those that threaten one's life while acting in the service of great and noble causes — and when some good comes from one's death. Going to war for one's country is the paradigmatic case.

> A[534]: "Poverty is not to be feared in the way a bad reputation is to be feared. Neither is sickness to be feared, nor indeed any of those things that do not pertain to wickedness of which man himself is the cause. It is useless for man to fear what he is unable to avoid. In regard to such things, therefore, a man ought to fear lest he fall into any of them by his own wickedness."

## Chapter 7 
### *Courage exemplified*

The courageous man fears and has confidence in the right way and at the right times, such that this is his state of character. Further, the choosing of fear or confidence is in respect to noble things, for which reason this virtue is considered noble. Most men err by fearing excessively, making them cowards.

> Sokolowski: "The brave man is to do the courageous thing, but also to have the appropriate kind and amount of fear."

> A[549]: "The ultimate end of operative virtue is happiness, a perfect good ... but the proximate and proper end is to impress a likeness of the habit on the act."
>
> A[554]: "The object of recklessness and fear is evil. But the object of hope and despair is good. ... What is essential causes that which is incidental. For this reason, hope — whose characteristic is to tend towards good — causes recklessness that tends towards the evil it attacks. For the same reason, fear, which flees evil, is the cause of despair, which withdraws from the good. He says, therefore, that the coward is a despairing man inasmuch as he fears his deficiency in everything. On the contrary, the brave man has great hope because he is courageous."

## Chapter 8 
### *Misconceptions about courage*

Of soldiers, citizen-soldiers exemplify courage, because they undertake dangers voluntarily for noble reasons. The pursuit of the noble end and the desire to avoid shame make it better than those who serve bravely but under compulsion (that is, because they fear the punishments of not serving).

> A[578]: "It is a mark of the brave man to suffer — for the sake of what is honorable and to avoid disgrace — evils that are terrifying to men, real evils and not merely apparent ones."

There are a number of common confusions about what really is courage. In some cases the experience of campaigning makes soldiers hardened against sudden scares that they know are harmless, which leads some to think of courage as a kind of knowledge. Others associate it with passion and working oneself into a frenzy, or to certain dispositions of personality. Even those ignorant of danger may seem brave when holding a difficult position, not realizing how difficult it is — although this action is obviously only due to their ignorance and not to virtue.

## Chapter 9
### *What motivates courage*

The rewards of successful courageous action can't fully explain a man's motivation in doing them, because often the reward is small compared to the risk they took. Paradoxically, this is the more true the more virtuous a man is, since the life he risks is that much more worthy and precious. So we must conclude that the real motivation for courageous acts is the pursuit of the noble and the avoidance of shame, rather than prizes and rewards.

> A[590] "We must consider, however, that to some virtuous men death is desirable on account of the hope of a future life. But the Stoics did not discuss this, nor did it pertain to the Philosopher in this work to speak of those things that belong to the condition of another life."

## Chapter 10
### *What temperance concerns*

Temperance, like courage, is a moral virtue, or an excellence of the irrational parts of our nature. It concerns especially the pleasures of touch and taste, while excess in pleasures of the other senses are usually thought of as something other than self-indulgent. What makes self-indulgence unseemly is its attachment to what is most bestial in man. It makes him brutish and animal like.

## Chapter 11
### *Appetites*

Appetites for food, drink, and sex, are "natural" in that they are shared by everyone, and almost without exception everyone tends to want them more than they ought. In addition to these, we all have particular things we take pleasure in that are unique to us. The self-indulgent man is excessive in both the quality and amount of pleasure he desires, and he is pained when his desires aren't fulfilled. Meanwhile, the temperate man desires neither pleasures that are too indulgent nor too much of the right kind of pleasures, and he is not pained when he abstains from pleasure.

## Chapter 12
### *Culpability for intemperance*

Pain is more disruptive to our ability to choose than pleasure, which means that particular acts of self-indulgence are more voluntary than acts of cowardice — and therefore more blameworthy. That said, the life of self-indulgence captures a man in a way cowardice does not, seemingly removing his ability to control himself once he has attained this bad state of character. For this reason self-indulgent men are compared to children, and as with children the only way out of the conundrum is to chasten and discipline, preferably at the hands of an instructor, until better moral character can be developed.
