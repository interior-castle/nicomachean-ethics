## Chapter 1
### Justice

The analysis of justice will follow the same method as was used for the moral virtues discussed in the prior books. We look for the state of character that makes just men just, and unjust men, unjust. The acts of unjust men in particular will stand out and be easier to notice, and by observing them we will learn about their contrary, which is justice.

The unjust man is widely believed to be grasping, lawless, and unfair. The just man, then, is law-abiding and fair. 

Laws aim at what's advantageous for all. They command individual men to be brave, temperate, of good temper, and in general to live out the virtues. While before we looked at these virtues from the point of view of personal advantage, it's clear that from the perspective of law — and therefore justice — there is also a communal benefit to virtue: a soldier holding his post helps an army secure victory; a temperate man won't commit adultery; a good-tempered man won't start fights.

The external benefits of virtue are thus seen as a part of justice, and for this reason justice can even be considered the whole of virtue — and injustice the whole of vice.

> Sokolowski: "Remember that justice for Aristotle is a virtue of an individual. It is the ability to transcend your own desire for your own advantage and to see things from a more objective point of view, in which your own good is compared with the goods of others."

> Sokolowski: "The term 'justice' is ambiguous and there are two kinds of justice, general justice and particular justice. *General justice* is lawfulness, being law-abiding. Such general justice is equivalent to virtue in its entirety, but with respect to other people. *Particular justice* or fairness is not equivalent to virtue in general, it is only a part of virtue. It is concerned with not wanting or taking more than your share of things. There are two corresponding senses of the unjust: being lawless and being grasping, wanting or taking too much, wanting or taking more than is appropriate."

> Sokolowski: "[Aristotle] implies that there is something rational and good about law in itself. The laws try to impose objectivity and reason into our passions and our doings. They even encourage temperance and other moral virtues."
