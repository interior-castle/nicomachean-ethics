# Book 1

I have always gotten the sense that philosophers don't quite know what to do with book 1 of the *Ethics*. One professor of mine suggested an alternative sequence for reading the book:

* **Book 1.13 only and then Book 7.1-10**: On *acrasia* (incontinence), the practical problem that spurs on ethical thinking — why do I do things I know I shouldn't do and which I don't want to do?
* **Book 2**: Virtue and vice, understanding moral actions
* **Book 3.1-5**: Moral responsibility and choice
* **Rest of book 3 and book 4**: Complicated treatment of various virtues
* **Book 5**: Justice, a virtue that seems to transcend because it deals with others, with relationships
* **Book 6**: Intellectual virtues, the foil to all of the practical stuff in moral virtue
* **Books 8 and 9**: Treatment of friendship (my professor considered this the true foundation of the good life, not justice, and in a sense the climax of the book — he calls it a masterful treatment of the subject)
* **Rest of book 7 (7.11-14) and book 10.1-5**: Pleasure and pain
* **Rest of book 10**: The contemplative life
* **Book 1.1-12**: General consideration of subject, questions and problems raised by it

## Chapter 1

"Every art and every kind of inquiry ..." — the good is that at which everything aims. But since there is a variety of concrete things aimed at, and some are subordinated to others, it follows that there is a hierarchy to ends.

## Chapter 2

Argument for one final end: without it, our choices among "competing" and subordinated ends wouldn't make sense. What's the chief end under which all activities can be organized? It always catches me by surprise that the first answer is politics — the emphasis on politics throughout book 1 always catches me by surprise when I read the *Ethics*.

## Chapter 3

Caution as to the limits of this subject: it won't be as precise or certain as other sciences. We should only expect the precision it can yield, which will be "roughly and in outline." In particular, young men should take caution in studying ethics, as this subject matter seems to be out of their reach in a sense. This is both because political knowledge and/or ethics requires much experience and practice if one is to become a good judge of it and because the young are prone to the passions in ways that cloud their judgment.

## Chapter 4

What is this highest good we are seeking? Common among nearly all men (uneducated and wise alike) is that it's happiness. As to what happiness consists of, there are too many opinions to review in this book. Aristotle will be making a fresh start of it, starting from what is known (through the variety of real-world experience) and proceeding from there to principles. Hence the importance of one having experience in making good practical judgments: only moral training can qualify a man to grasp what is most noble and just, which in turn is the starting point of politics.

## Chapter 5

The most popular choices for the good life fall into three categories: pleasure, activity/honor, and contemplation. A life dominated by pleasure can be dismissed immediately as the domain of bestial men of no importance or interest to us. What most consider refined or noble is the life dedicated to activity/honor, but Aristotle thinks this must be too superficial for a final answer. Not only does it depend too much on what others think, but virtue seems like a better candidate. 

Yet even virtue on its own may be deficient, as other factors out of our control (like tragedies) may still make a man unhappy. There must be more to the story if happiness is to consist in virtue.

Moneymaking, like pleasure, is quickly ruled out, as it is subordinate by necessity to other ends.

## Chapter 6

What is the universal good, then? Plato's theories are found inadequate for five reasons:
1. (I don't understand this argument.) There is no common idea in the case of things where one is prior to the other. Predicate good is applied to substances, qualities, relations. But substance, of independent existence, is logically prior to what is relative, for the relative is an accident of a substance. Therefore there can't be a common idea of these goods.
2. (I only sort of understand this argument.) Good is used in diverse and equivocal ways, as many as there are ways of using the term "being." Thus it can't stand for one and the same notion in every application. But the good we are looking for is singular.
3. There is no single science of good that applies to the various goods of arts and sciences (strategy for war, health for medicine), but there would be if the notion was one.
4. (I don't understand this objection.)
5. Objection to a Platonist contention that the eternal good is better than a non-eternal good: if something is good, it's good. Longer duration does not change its quality.

These points could all spur further discussion, but the basic point is that the Platonists do not have a singular science of the good but rather welcome the diverse goods that appear in various accounts and arts. He seems to form a sixth argument here:
- There are two types of goods: those desired for their own sake and those desired for the sake of some further good
- The goods in themselves are things like wisdom, sight, certain pleasures and honors.
- It must be shown that the goodness of all of them can be defined in the same terms, as white has the same meaning when applied to snow and to white lead
- But, in fact, we have to give different accounts of the goodness of honor, wisdom, and pleasure
- Good, therefore, is not a term applied to all alike or with reference to one common idea or form

Furthermore, how would knowledge of a universal good help a weaver or carpenter in their task? What would be the practical use of this knowledge? Does anyone in a particular art seek an abstract good? Of course, no.

The project of a universal good, then, is better left abandoned for now.

## Chapter 7

Back to the question of what this ultimate good is. If it is an ultimate good, then it will be the end for the sake of which all other subordinate ends are chosen. What makes it ultimate or best? It must be final, never chosen as a means. Happiness does fit this description. Likewise, the ultimate end should be self-sufficient. Again, happiness fits that description. Further, the ultimate end should be the most desirable thing in the world; it must transcend other goods such that the ultimate end + other goods wouldn't improve the ultimate end. Again, happiness.

Settling on happiness, we need to define it more precisely. First step: What is the function of man? Not just a particular kind of man (carpenter, sculptor), but man as man? We look at our nature — vegetative, sensible, rational — and rule out what we have in common with plants and animals. That leaves the life of his rational nature. "The result is that the good of man is the exercise of his faculties in accordance with excellence or virtue." And added to that, that this be done for a "full term" and not just a day. It should be a *life* of exercising reason well.

We have arrived here by sketching an outline and filling in details, and Aristotle thinks this is a solid foundation to our inquiry that will obviate a number of difficulties. ("A good start is more than half the race.")

## Chapter 8

With the foundation in place, we return to the common notions of happiness to compare. Of the three kinds of goods — external goods, goods of the body, goods of the soul — our definition of happiness is a good of the soul, which is fitting. It fits with other common notions of what the happy man is like and what characteristics people think happiness has. Our notion of happiness includes candidates like virtue, prudence, wisdom. It includes pleasure, which some think a necessary ingredient. Happiness, then, can be at once the best, noblest, and most pleasant thing in the world — we don't have to separate them as competing ends.

Happiness does seem to require some external goods too, although their absence is better described as "taking the bloom off our happiness" rather than utterly destroying it. External goods seem to relate to our happiness more often by likelihoods than by necessities: For example, can an ugly, low-born person be happy? Perhaps, but it's harder. Etc.

## Chapter 9

How do we acquire happiness? Our foundational definition shows the way: it isn't given to us like a gift, but something we learn and acquire over a life.

## Chapter 10

Problem: because a terrible end to one's life (such as Priam's, losing his family and city and being killed) can make one unhappy, does that mean we have to "wait until the end" to call someone happy? And what about men after death: can their status change? 

Here the primacy of the exercise of faculties wins out: whatever the circumstances of external goods, they aren't ultimately what counts. Happiness through the exercise of rational nature will have a permanence and preserve a man's character. Small evils won't affect it, and even large misfortunes can't entirely snuff out true worth. For the man of true worth will deal with great misfortunes with nobility and greatness of soul; he will do as well as one can. The happy man will thus never become miserable, although he will not be truly happy if the very worst fate of external misfortune befalls him (like Priam).

A refined definition of happiness taking into account these objections: "A happy man is one who exercises his faculties in accordance with perfect excellence, being duly furnished with external goods, not for any chance time, but for a full term of years — and who shall continue to live so, and shall die as he lived."

## Chapter 11

What of the fortunes of descendants and friends? We should say these affect happiness to some extent in proportion to their closeness and importance to the man. But while it may affect how we view the dead, it doesn't make them happy or unhappy in retrospect.

## Chapter 12

Is happiness among the goods we praise or among those we prize (revere)? Among the prized seems more appropriate, as it is final and valued for its own sake. That which is praised is put in relation to something else. Happiness thus seems like something divine.

## Chapter 13

Refined, shortened working definition of happiness that we are taking with us outside book 1: "Happiness is an exercise of the vital faculties in accordance with perfect virtue or excellence." It's clear now that we need to explore virtue and excellence to better understand happiness.

We and those practicing politics are looking for the excellence of man, which is to say the excellence of soul. Thus politicians must have some knowledge of the soul and inquire into the nature of the soul and what is the soul's excellence. The nutritive can be dismissed as having no share in man's excellence. But the faculty of desire or appetite cannot be entirely dismissed: despite being irrational, it participates in our rational decision-making and can submit or oppose the reason. It is due to our faculty of desire/appetite that there is a distinction between purely intellectual virtues and the moral virtues.
